## MF
To connect local MF running in another port add `<mf-name>=http://localhost:<port>` to `.env.local` file
```
cond-app-root=http://localhost:3001
```
## Dev server port
To setup dev server port add `DEV_SERVER_PORT` to `.env.local` file
```
DEV_SERVER_PORT=3002
```

## Code Style

The project setup with common Conductor's eslint rules.  


## Tests

`Jest` and `React-testing-library` used for testing.

## Cypress Tests
To write Cypress tests you need to start the app in dev mode

`npm run start:ci`

Then open Cypress app by

`npm run cypress:open`

Pick a test file you're working on and launch it. Now you can easily alter or add new tests.
Note that u can use `Cypress` and `Jest` tests in parallel. Both test reports will merge together to generate total coverage report.

## Git Hooks

[Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) used to prevent bad `git commit` and `git push`.

-   Eslint validates and formats ts/js files regards the rules
-   Stylelint validates and formats css files regards the rules


## Proxy for API requests

This project provides an ability to use a proxy during development to get any API requests working without running the monolith locally.

To use it you should:

- [Launch ODSL using Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.int.infra.us-east-1.conductor.sh/#/applications/on-demand-searchlight/executions)
- Obtain a URL to launched ODSL
- Add `.env.local` file with the following contents:
    ```
    BACKEND_URL=https://<PUT_YOUR_ODSL_ENV_URL_HERE>
    ```
Please note, that proxy will only work until your ODSL env is running. After that you'll have to start new ODSL with the same "Stack Name" or update `.env.local` to point to new URL.
